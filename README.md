# Pizza

Hello and welcome to the Pizza repo!

You're probably wondering what the heck is going on here.

Basically, this repository houses guides and demos for various syntax rules and behaviours in Javascript.

The best way to use this repo is to clone it and get [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) running on your machine.

This will allow you to run any of the `.js` files using `node [FILENAME].js`, where `[FILENAME]` is the name of the file
you want to run.

The files themselves should be opened and thoroughly read through. There's lots of comments in there that explain a lot
about JS and ES6! ESPECIALLY the promises one.

Anyways, enjoy! And feel free to poke me about anything I should add.
